Submitted by: **Suhaas Achanta**

**Task App** is an app that allows users to create, manage, and complete tasks, with due dates and calendar-based tracking. Tasks persist even after closing the app.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App displays a list of tasks
- [x] Users can add tasks to the list
- [x] Session persists when application is closed and relaunched (tasks don't get deleted when closing app)
- [x] Note: You have to quit the app, not minimize it, in order to see the persistence.
- [x] Tasks can be deleted

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- At first, the app wouldn't launch due to not setting the correct entry point after embedding in a tab bar controller.
- Navigation controller wasn't correctly attached to the tasks view, so the "+" button didnâ€™t show up until fixed.
- Had to understand how to encode/decode custom `Task` structs for persistence.
